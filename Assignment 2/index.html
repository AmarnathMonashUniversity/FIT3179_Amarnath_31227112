  <p>
    Do you know that the international students in Australia occupy almost 40% of the student population? 
    In that, around 23.6% of students are currently studying on-campus. This percentage figure is almost 
    10% lower when compared to the pre-coronavirus pandemic period. Particularly, in this visualisation you will be able
    to analyse the trend in student migration from various parts of the world, entering Australia to pursue
    their higher studies where only 17 countries are mainly analyzed in this visualisation. So, the 17 countries include Bangladesh, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea (Republic of South),
    Malaysia, Nepal, Norway, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America and Vietnam.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, you will be able to witness the trends of international student migration at each of the 8 states and other territories in Australia which includes
    New South Wales(NSW), Victoria(VIC), Queensland(QLD), South Australia(SA), Western Australia(WA), Tasmania(TAS), Northern Territory(NT),
    Australian Capital Territory(ACT) and Other Territories(OT). The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on student migration are discussed while showcasing 
    which of the major countries and states are being affected through various visualisations.

    <h2>Map of Student Migration into Australia</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      A world map visualisation is shown below where all the countries are included. It shows the number of students migrating away
      from various countries and entering Australia. It can be seen that India and China contain a higher proportion of students travelling
      to Australia to pursue their studies. Certain countries were not included in the data which are represented through the greyed-out 
      parts in the map. From the data, Middle-East countries contain the least number of students travelling to Australia. A few key interactivity 
      features are provided to observe the trend over the years from 2002 to 2021 through a filter slider while the zoom level can be adjusted through 
      a zoom slider to enhance the view of the map.

               From the data, it can be seen that the international students come various countries around the world which emphasises the point
               that Australia is a popular spot among students who are pursuing their higher studies. In the area chart visualisation, a total of 
               17 countries are shown. Over the years, the number of students migrating away from China and Bangladesh have increased dramatically.
               In the case of countries such as India and Nepal have seen a steady growth in the influx of students into Australia. The visualisation
               provided contains interactivity features such as filtering and tooltips which contains vital information of all points in the area chart.
               So, it is recommended that you filter out the desired country through the selection menu and build on your understanding about the student
               migration in Australia.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Furthermore, the data shows that when the COVID-19 pandemic was announced and the international borders were restricted and closed for travelling,
            it massively affected the students migrating from other countries. It was estimated that around 24% of the students currently studying online were
            affected by border closure. This was the main reason for the drastic decrease and downward slope trend in the visualisation from 2019 to 2021.

               From the donut chart, it can observed that students coming from China and India hold a higher proportion compared to other countries. Over the 
               years, both the countries contain a steady proportion of student influx into Australia. Interactivity features such as selection filter and tooltips 
               are available to witness the quantity of students migrated into Australia. The selection filter can be used to filter out the desired country and view 
               the information about student migration.

      An Australian map visualisation is shown below where all the states are included. It shows the number of migrating students entering various states in Australia. 
      It can be seen that New South Wales and Victoria contain a higher proportion of students pursuing their studies. From the data, Northern Territory and Tasmania contain

              From the data, it can be seen that at each of the states in Australia contain a steady proportion of international students over the years.
              In the stacked bar chart visualisation, a total of 9 states including other territories are shown. Over the years, the number of students
              preferring to pursue their studies at states such as New South Wales and Victoria have increased. In the case of states such as Queensland 
              and South Australia have seen a steady growth in the influx of students. The visualisation provided contains interactivity features such as 
              filtering and tooltips which contains vital information at all points in the stacked bar chart. So, it is recommended to filter out the desired state

            From the scatterplot, it can observed that students have always changed institutions between various states in Australia. Sometimes, migrated students
            transfer courses or institutions due to change in accomodation facilities or issues in travelling diastance. Over the years, other territories and Australian Capital Territory 
            states have seen international students migrate to other states such as New South Wales and Victoria. This can be analysed through the relationship between the enrolment and commencement 
            data of the migrated students. Interactivity features such as selection filter and tooltips are available to witness the quantity of students migrated between various states in Australia. 
            The selection filter can be used to filter out the desired state and view the information about student migration between various states.

   <h2>So, what did we understand from this overall visualisation?</h2>
  </div>
   <p>
     From analysing all of the above data, we can conclude that all the states in Australia are gaining a lot of migrating international students from other countries around the world 
     such as India and China. From all these states in Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have always seen a high number of international students preferring to pursue their
     higher studies.
   </p><br>
   <p>
     Due to an unprecedented impact of COVID-19 pandemic, all the states in Australia have seen a declining trend in the incoming of migrating students where they got affected financially and 
     international border closures especially countries such as Bangladesh and Nepal. Furthermore, it was observed that more migrating students are willing to transfer courses or institutions 
     where they migrate between states, which reflects the high standards and flexibilities present in the education sector in Australia.
